# Meth's personal website - Updated

Here lies the code for my [personal website](https://meth.lk), which has been
updated to use Next.JS from the previous Gatsby based site (ikr what was I even
thinking)

It's a bit more sleek looking and waaay snappier thanks to server side
rendering :D

This is still a work in progress. The codebase for the old site can be found
[here](https://github.com/muffledMitosis/old-meth-dot-dev)
